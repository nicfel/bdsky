## bdsky - Birth Death Serial Skyline Model for BEAST2, adapted for Flu Basel Project

This repo contains and adapted version of the original [BDSKY code](https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/bdsky). It has some changes to allow it to better handle absolute time changes. It further implements a skygrid style smooting prior and some primitiv operators to explore R0's. Also, it allows to parameterize the R0's in log space (to work with the normal smooting prior).
